# Basic django polls page

A very quick project   *still in progress*   to create a basic polls page which is made up of two parts:

1. A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them
2. A Django admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls

Running requires navigating to mysite/mysite in the command line and running the server with: python manage.py runserver
