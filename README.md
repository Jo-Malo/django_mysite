# django_mysite

A very quick project   *still in progress*   to create a basic polls page which is made up of two parts:

1. A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them
2. An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls

To run the polls page, navigate to mysite/mysite in the command line and run the server with: python manage.py runserver
